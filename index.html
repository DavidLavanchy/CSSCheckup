    <h3>TPC Scottsdale Hole 16 "Enclosed"</h3>

    width="400px" height="400px">

    <p>The 16th at TPC's Scottsdale is iconic not for it's layout, but for it's format. This is a hole that looks more like an NFL arena than a golf hole with it's fully enclosed fiarway and green. The audience adds an element to the play that most of these tour players don't experience. When someone sticks a shot close to the pin on the 16th, the crowd goes wild.</p>

    <h3>"Azalea" or the 13th at Augusta</h3>
    <img src="C:\ElevenFiftyProjects\HTMLCSSPreWork\Assets\38b06b1e-0cc1-458d-83d1-d6cddb75f6c3.jpg"
    width="400px" height="400px">
    <p>The 13th at Augusta is a staple on that Masters Sunday each year in April. The hole is a short Par 5 with a slight dogleg left. The players are greeted with a tempting pin guarded by bunkers to the back and a stream in the front. The contours of the fairway make for some tricky lies on the approach, and the greens are fast forcing players to know their distances down to the tenth of a yard.</p>

    <h3>The Seaside Par 4 at Pebble Beach</h3>
    <img src="C:\ElevenFiftyProjects\HTMLCSSPreWork\Assets\Pebble-Beach-8th-Hole-1800x1200.jpg"
    width="400px" height="400px">
    <p>The 8th hole at Pebble Beach is one of the most picturesque holes in  the game of golf. Jack Nicklaus decsribed it as the best approach shot in the game. Players will have to mash a tee shot into the fairway, alluding the Pacific Ocean to the west. Then, depending on how far their approach shot went, risk coming up short and losing their ball, and chances at a major win, in Stillwater Cove.</p>

    <h3>The Old Course's Home Stretch</h3>

    <p>Scotland, golf's origins. The 18th at the Old Course has been the sight of many major victories in golfs lineage. One of the mostphotographed holes on the planet, even before instagram!.</p>
